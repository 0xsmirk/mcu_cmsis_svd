# SVD files for Espressif chips

These files have not been provided by Espressif. Instead, they have been
created by the Rust Embedded community, either by extracting from the ESP-IDF
(licensed under the Apache 2.0 license), or manually filling in the rest that
could not be extracted automatically.
